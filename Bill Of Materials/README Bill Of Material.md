# Bill of Materials

The bill of materials includes the parts required to build a Printer Kitten as well as recomended sources to buy them from.

Please keep in mind.
-Some of the items in the bill of materials are multiple of a certain part. This is most applicable to boxes of screws and other such hardware. If you order the recomended part number there will be extras of the part, sometimes enough to build another printer. Please keep this in mind if you plan to order parts for multiple printers.

# Why have assemblies of parts?

These assemblies of parts can make it easier/faster to print Printer Kitten parts.
 
Printing all of the assemblies will make enough parts for a Kitten minus the BondTech extruder housings. These can be purchased from Bondtech. If you want to print your own, the files for these are in the Individual STLs folder. 

The size of these assemblies are small enough to be printed on a Printer Kitten.

# Tips

If you plan on having a heated bed, I recommend not printing the print head out of PLA because of the fan shrouds proximity to the bed.

The parts for the extruder can be purchased from Bondtech. If you want to print your own, the files are available on the Bondtech website.

# Assemblies of Parts

The assemblies of parts can make it easier/faster to print Printer Kitten parts.
 
Printing all of the assemblies will make enough parts for a Kitten. 

The size of these assemblies are small enough to be printed on a Printer Kitten.

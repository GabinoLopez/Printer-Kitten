##Aligning Belts

No new parts

Push back X end all the way to right (back right corner) until the end contacts the pulley

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_158.JPG)

Puch front X end all the way to right (front right corner) until the end contacts the pulley

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_159.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the right XY rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_160.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the lower pulley in the front right corner using a 1.5mm allen key. You need to get at least one of the two set screws tightened in this configuration. If the other set screw is unreachable you can move the x axis after the first one has been tightened.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_161.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the left XY rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_162.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the lower pulley in the front left corner using a 1.5mm allen key. It does not matter where the x axis is positioned when tightening so it can be moved to reach the screws

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_163.JPG)

If done properly if you move one X end printed part the other one should move in sync and both should contact their limits at the same time.

Push right Y end all the way to the back right corner as shown until the end contacts the pulley

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_164.JPG)

Push left Y end all the way to the back left corner as shown until the end contacts the pulley

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_165.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the back rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_166.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the upper pulley in the back left corner using a 1.5mm allen key. You need to get at least one of the two set screws tightened in this configuration. If the other set screw is unreachable you can move the x axis after the first one has been tightened.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_167.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the front rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_168.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the upper pulley in the front left corner using a 1.5mm allen key. It does not matter where the y axis is positioned when tightening so it can be moved to reach the screws

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_169.JPG)

If done properly if you move one Y end printed part the other one should move in sync and both should contact their limits at the same time.

At this point all the set screws of the pulleys should be tightened and the tape can be removed

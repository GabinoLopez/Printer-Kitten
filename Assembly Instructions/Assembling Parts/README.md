![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_159.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the right XY rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_160.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the lower pulley in the front right corner using a 1.5mm allen key. You need to get at least one of the two set screws tightened in this configuration. If the other set screw is unreachable you can move the x axis after the first one has been tightened.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_161.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the left XY rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_162.JPG)

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_166.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the upper pulley in the back left corner using a 1.5mm allen key. You need to get at least one of the two set screws tightened in this configuration. If the other set screw is unreachable you can move the x axis after the first one has been tightened.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_167.JPG)

Ensure that pulleys and spacers on the front rod are all the way justified outwards.

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_168.JPG)

Tighten the set screws on the upper pulley in the front left corner using a 1.5mm allen key. It does not matter where the y axis is positioned when tightening so it can be moved to reach the screws

![Assembly Picture](./Raw Assembly Pictures/PKA_169.JPG)

If done properly if you move one Y end printed part the other one should move in sync and both should contact their limits at the same time.

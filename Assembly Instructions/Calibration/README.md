# Calibration

## Bed level and Z-axis offset calibration

Run the gcode file [BedLevel_ZOffset.gcode](https://github.com/woolfepr/Printer-Kitten/blob/master/Assembly%20Instructions/Calibration/BedLevel_ZOffset.gcode) Copy it to the SD card, put the SD card in the printer. On the bottom of the main menu on the display it should say print from SD, navigate to the file run it.

After the Z-Axis has come to rest move the print head so the nozzle is above the left rear adjustment screw.

Using about a 1"x 3" piece of standard printer paper (â‰ˆ0.1mm thick) as a feeler gauge between the nozzle and build plate, turn the bed adjustment knob to move the bed up towards the nozzle. Move the bed up until as you move the piece of paper in and out you just start feeling resistance and the piece of paper buckles as you push it in.

Repeat the previous step for the front left and then front right. (note: the nozzle will not be able to move all the way right to go over the font right adjustment screw. Just move it as far right as it goes)

Power cycle the printer

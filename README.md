## Printer Kitten Design Story
#### 3/31/16 - *Patrick Woolfenden*

The first printer I built was Sublime’s Tantillus. The Tantillus’ small size and print quality is what drew me to it. The Ultimaker style X and Y axes motion system was fascinating. For me, the Tantillus turned out to be a first great printer. It wasn’t the easiest to put together, and I had to source all of the parts myself, but in the end it didn’t disappoint delivering exceptional print quality. 

Inspired by the Tantillus and the other T-Slot Tantillus and Ultimaker style printers, such as Brad Hill’s T-Slot Tantillus, Tim Rastall’s Ingentus, and Eric Lien’s HurcuLien, I set off to design my own version. This printer had a 200mm x 200mm print area and was roughly the same size as the Ultimaker. It used a 20mm extrusion frame, and used toothed belts where the tantillus had used high tension fishing line. After meeting Martin Bondéus At the 2015 Midwest RepRap Festival I decided to try the Bondtech extruder. It proved to be much more consistent and reliable than the Tantillus extruders I was used to. The printer worked well and produced great prints, but had its own set of issues. It remains unreleased as I do not think it is ready enough for other people to try to build. While it did work well and had many unique design features that found their way to the kitten, I still see as bit of another medium sized box type printer.

The next printer I designed was the kitten. Reflecting back to Midwest RepRap Festivals I had attended, I remembered how the Tantillus design intrigued people because of its small compact design. I decided to make my next printer a compact portable printer. 

I enjoyed the challenge of trying to package all of the printer components into as small and spatially efficient layout as I could. In order to make the printer very compact, the Kitten was first laid out with all of the X and Y axes, print head, and frame purchased parts positioned in space. I iterated, trying different motor sizes and positions, rod diameters, bearings sizes, ect, keeping in mind I would be designing printed parts to hold parts together. 15mm T-slot extrusion, Nema 14, and an E3D V6 lite hot end were decided on. After feeling happy about the compact packaging layout, I began designing the printed part for printhead. Once that was roughly design I moved on to the rest of the X and Y axes, making slight tweaks to the component layout as necessary. A clever way to tension the belts is key to the compact design. To fit in the small space available, hall effect switches are used for end stops. At this point I was confident that the frame foot print would be a 200mm square with a 100mm square print area. The X and Y axes and printhead were the most challenging parts of the printer with the goal of as small of a foot print as possible. 

For the Z-axis I opted for a simple cantilevered bed. 10mm rods and flanged linear bearings were used because they were the largest that were able to fit without causing the printer to be get bigger. These oversized parts make the kitten’s small bed very sturdy. A nema14 stepper motor with an integrated lead screw is used to move the bed. In order to keep it simple and stiff, I decided to make the bed out of 2 metal plates. A silicone heated pad is used for bed heating. Leveling the bed is easy with 3 adjustment nuts. 

The Ultimachine mini-rambo was a great fit for the kitten’s control electronics because of its ease of use, low profile, and small foot print. I stuck with the Bondtech V2 extruder for the kitten. While the kitten uses nema 14 motors for the x, y, and z axes, it still uses the standard nema 17 for the extruder. I designed a pivoting spool holder that can be folded away to retain the kittens small size for travel. Since the first kitten, the printed parts have gone through many iterations to get to their current state. All of the printed parts on the kitten have been designed to be possible to print without support material. One part has a break away support modeled directly into the STL file. During the couple months leading up to the 2016 Midwest RepRap Festival, I built 2 more kittens and made a kit for a friend who built his and provided me feedback. My friend Matt Skorina and I went to the Midwest RepRap festival with 3 kittens, ready to debut them to the 3D printing community.
